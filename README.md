# Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis
## IISc CCE AI/ML Capstone Project - Topic modeling and sentiment analysis based on user review data.

### Purpose: 
This project aims to take user reviews as inputs and figure out the following:
* Figure out topics discussed
* Model the topics
* Topic clustering
* Unsupervised sentiment analysis on each topic cluster providing Top N positive, negative, and neutral sentiment topics
* Figuring out the Top N impactful topic for overall rating improvement

### Approach:
We are taking a phased approach to achieve the goal. The following phases will be carried out:

#### Milestone-1
* Cleaning and preparing data
* Topic modeling
* Unsupervised topic clustering
* End of Milestone-1 - Top N trending topic

#### Milestone-2
* Unsupervised sentiment analysis on each topic cluster
* End of Milestone-2 - Top N positive, negative, and neutral sentiment topics

#### Milestone-3
* End of Milestone-3 - Top N impactful topic for overall rating improvement

### Dataset:
We are considering a few different datasets. In this branch, I will be working with a Kaggle dataset "[New York Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhonarosecortez/new-york-airbnb-open-data/data) ". This a fairly large dataset with recent updates. Once we have a working model we can use other similar datasets to test out the model such as [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/discovering-new-york-city-through-airbnb-user-re/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/discovering-new-york-city-through-airbnb-user-re/data) and [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/berlin-airbnb-ratings-and-reviews-overview/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/berlin-airbnb-ratings-and-reviews-overview/data)
